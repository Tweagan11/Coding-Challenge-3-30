# THIS WAS FOR A BYU JOB APPLICATION FOR THEIR OIT STUDENT PROGRAMMER. I WAS OFFERED THE JOB, BUT COULDN'T ACCEPT DUE TO TRANSFERRING SCHOOLS

Welcome to my Roman Numeral Calculator!

This calculator gives the user an option to choose between Roman Numeral to Number, and Number to Roman Numeral!

It accounts for all kinds of input, so negative numbers and numbers above 4000 aren't typically allowed. It will still compute for the most part, it just won't be standard notation.

To build my GUI, I used tkinter and CustomTkinter for an easy interface that would talk with my code.

To create this as an executable file, I used the auto-py-to-exe library.


**TO USE THE APPLICATION**

Please download the main.zip file and extract all files. There will be a main.exe file that you should be able to use, don't worry about the rest.

If you'd like to see my code, all files that end in .py are available to look at, download, and run if you desire.

(When downloading and running the RomanConverter file, I did get a warning that it may be a virus. This is a false positive, but if you'd rather run my code in a Python IDE, then feel free, they should run the exact same)
