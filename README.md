Welcome to my Roman Numeral Calculator!

This calculator gives the user an option to choose between Roman Numeral to Number, and Number to Roman Numeral!

It accounts for all kinds of input, so negative numbers and numbers above 4000 aren't typically allowed. It will still compute for the most part, it just won't be standard notation.

To build my GUI, I used tkinter and CustomTkinter for an easy interface that would talk with my code.

To create this as an executable file, I used the auto-py-to-exe library.
